# HICRON's Hackathon

# âš¡ What is the challenge about?

This project was developed during HICRON's Hackathon with the aim of creating an app to manage employee vacations.

ðŸ’¥ It was a true challenge and a great opportunity to develop and learn a fullstack app without being used these technologies before. 

* The challenge is not fully complete, the app allows employees to submit vacation requests, but the manager 
functionalities are not yet available.


# :computer: Technologies

We must use:

* ``PostgreSQL`` for the database.
* ``Node.js`` and ``Express`` for the backend.
* ``Angular`` for the frontend.

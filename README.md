This project was developed during HICRON's Hackathon with the aim of creating an app to manage employee vacations. 

The challenge is not fully complete, the app allows employees to submit vacation requests, but the manager 
functionalities are not yet available.

We must use:
PostgreSQL for the database, Node.js and Express for the backend, and Angular for the frontend.

It was a true challenge and a great opportunity to develop and learn a fullstack app without being used these technologies before.
